# School Coding Projects
This repository contains a collection of coding projects completed during my time in school. The projects vary in language and complexity, demonstrating my proficiency in a range of programming skills.

## Checkers Game (Python)
The first project is a chess game written in Python. This program allows two users to play a 2D chess game, featuring a visual display of the board layout in the form of an array. The program implements a range of chess piece movements, and validates move conditions for regular, king, and triple king pieces. The game also checks for the winning conditions, ensuring an accurate and enjoyable gaming experience for users.

## Signed Integer Validation and Calculation (MASM x86)
The second project is a program written in Assembly language. This program prompts users to enter 10 signed integers that are only 32 bits long, with a built-in validation system to ensure accurate inputs. It provides a list of the 10 entered integers, calculates the truncated average, and concludes with a farewell message. The program is designed to optimize processing time and produce accurate results, making it an efficient and effective tool for integer manipulation.
