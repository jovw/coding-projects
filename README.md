# School Coding Projects
This repository contains a collection of coding projects completed during my time in school. The projects vary in language and complexity, demonstrating my proficiency in a range of programming skills.

## Checkers Game (Python)
This checkers game project is written in Python. This program allows two users to play a 2D chess game, featuring a visual display of the board layout in the form of an array. The program implements a range of chess piece movements, and validates move conditions for regular, king, and triple king pieces. The game also checks for the winning conditions, ensuring an accurate and enjoyable gaming experience for users.

## Signed Integer Validation and Calculation (MASM x86)
This project is written in Assembly language. This program prompts users to enter 10 signed integers that are only 32 bits long, with a built-in validation system to ensure accurate inputs. It provides a list of the 10 entered integers, calculates the truncated average, and concludes with a farewell message. The program is designed to optimize processing time and produce accurate results, making it an efficient and effective tool for integer manipulation.

## Reliable Data Transmission (RDT)
My RDT program is implemented in Python. For this coding project, I have developed the RDT layer, enabling the transmission of string data through an unreliable channel within a simulated environment. The project tests the effectiveness of data transfer in scenarios involving potential issues like out-of-order packets, dropped packets, packet delays, and data errors.
